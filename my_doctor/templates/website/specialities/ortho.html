                      An orthopaedician focuses on the treatment & prevention of skeletal deformities such as disorders of the bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons, nerves, and skin. They treat fractures and dislocations, sports injuries, sciatica, low back pain, ruptured disks and scoliosis, knock knees, bowlegs, bunions and hammer toes, arthritis, osteoporosis and more. Some of the common reasons or symptoms why an individual may want to visit an orthopaedician are:

                    <br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>-If you have been experiencing back pain, shoulder pain or knee pain for a while which increases with movement, it might be a possible sign of tendonitis which causes the tendon to become inflamed and swell up.</li>
                      <li>-Any pain from repetitive motions like climbing stairs, walking, or cycling you might need to get a joint replacement surgery done. </li>
                      <li>-Any chronic bone pain that lasts for more than six months and is affecting your daily life is an indication of damaged or painful joints.</li>
                      <li>-If you have swollen joints you must be suffering from bursitis in which the wrists become bruised and swollen.</li>

                      An individual is typically required to visit a bone specialist doctor when he or she is suffering from one or more of the following conditions:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      When one or more of your joints become tender and swell up and you face difficulty in walking then you are most likely suffering from arthritis. This condition typically worsens with age and is also more common among the elder people.  
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      The two most common types of this condition are rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      When you have suffered a fracture in any part of your body due to an injury or an accident then it indicates broken bone, cracked bone or some sort of muscle spasm. It is imperative to get it treated at the earliest. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      If you have been suffering from lower back pain for a while now then it may be an indication of a disc that has ruptured or is bulging.  
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      When the tendons in your elbow are overloaded, then this painful condition is called tennis elbow. This pain will only increase with time and cause more discomfort if it does not receive timely treatment.
