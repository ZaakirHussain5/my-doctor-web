    <p>We collect two kinds of information from you when you visit the Website and use our services.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Firstly</strong>, we collect any information you voluntarily provide to us. For example, if you call or email us via the details provided on the ‘Contact Us’ page, we collect that information. Any and all information that you post or otherwise provide to Doctor-Plus by means of this website shall be true and accurate, not misleading, and offered in good faith.</p>
